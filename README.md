# TF2-Mods
<p>Here I'll be releasing all of the mods I made for Team Fortress 2 on The Orange Box. These were made between 2012-2014. You are free to use this code and any way you see fit. If you want help compiling an ISO and burning it to a disc, feel free to contact me and I may be able to help you.</p>

### [Config Files](./cfgs)
<p>These are (mostly) small snippets of code and the main config files used for accessing everything in-game.</p>

### [Test Scripts](./testscripts)
<p>These are larger scripts that mostly contain entire mini-games.</p>
