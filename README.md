# TF2-Mods
Here I'll be releasing all of the mods I made for Team Fortress 2 on The Orange Box. These were made between 2012-2014. You are free to use this code in any way you see fit. Without further editing of your zip0.360.zip, specifically the game_sounds.txt file, these mods will be very unstable; if you want help compiling an ISO and burning it to a disc, feel free to contact me and I may be able to help you.

### [Config Files](cfg/) ###
These are (mostly) small snippets of code and the main config files used for accessing everything in-game.

### [Test Scripts](testscripts/) ###
These are larger scripts that mostly contain entire mini-games.
