# TF2-Mods
<p>Here I'll be releasing all of the mods I made for Team Fortress 2 on The Orange Box. These were made between 2012-2014. You are free to use this code and any way you see fit. If you want help compiling an ISO and burning it to a disc, feel free to contact me and I may be able to help you.</p>

<h3>[CFGs](cfgs)</h3>
<p>These are the config files, (mostly) small snippets of code and the main config files used for accessing everything in-game.</p>
